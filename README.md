# Kubernetes Architecture and Components, Kubernetes Installation and Configuration


# Kubernetes
Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling and management of the containerized application. Its main feature is automatic container placement self-healing and scalability.

Kubernetes is a tool that helps developers deploy, manage and scale their applications in an automated way. It allows developers to package their applications into containers and deploy them to cluster machines. Kubernetes take care of managing and scaling them as needed.

# Kubernetes Components
# Master Node
# Kube API Server
The kube API server is a component to communicate with the control panel, kube scheduler, etc, kube controller manager

# Kube Scheduler
It is responsible for assigning pods to needs in the cluster based on resource availability and other constraints. (when a new pod is created, the schedular receives the pod specification and selects a suitable node for pods to run on.)

# Etcd
Kubernetes components store and configure data state information and metadata about the cluster.

# Kube Controller Manager
It is responsible for monitoring the state of various resources within the cluster and taking corrective actions as needed to bring the cluster to the desired state.

# Worker Node

# Kubelet
The components run on each worker node in the Kubernetes cluster and are responsible for managing the containers running on that nodes.

# Kube-proxy
It is responsible for handling network traffic in the Kubernetes cluster. It setups network routing rules and load balancing for the containers running on each node.

# Pod
Pods are the Smallest unit of Kubernetes that represent one or more containers.

# Kubernetes Installation and Configuration
Kubeadm and Minikube are both tools that facilitate the deployment and management of Kubernetes Clusters but they are different purposes.

# What you'll need
2 CPUs or more

2GB of free memory

20GB of free disk space

Internet connection

*Kubeadm is used to create and manage production-ready Kubernetes clusters on cloud providers or bare-metal servers.

* Minikube is used for the local development and testing of Kubernetes applications.

Kubeadm Installation: https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/tools/kubeadm/install-kubeadm/

This Step is Installing in the Linux operating system.

Update the apt package index and install packages needed to use the Kubernetes apt repository:


    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates curl
    
    
Download the Google Cloud public signing key:
    
    sudo curl -fsSLo /etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg https://packages.cloud.google.com/apt/doc/apt-key.gpg


Add the Kubernetes apt repository:

    echo "deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/kubernetes-archive-keyring.gpg] https://apt.kubernetes.io/ kubernetes-xenial main" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/kubernetes.list


Update apt package index, install kubelet, kubeadm and kubectl, and pin their version:
    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install -y kubelet kubeadm kubectl
    sudo apt-mark hold kubelet kubeadm kubectl

Minikube Installation: https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/

To install the latest minikube stable release on x86-64 Linux using binary download

    curl -LO https://storage.googleapis.com/minikube/releases/latest/minikube-linux-amd64
    sudo install minikube-linux-amd64 /usr/local/bin/minikube

    minikube start
